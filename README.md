# Taiwanese Real Estate Valuation Dataset EDA
Exploratory Data Analysis using Python
## Overview
In this project, I take a look at a Taiwanese real estate valuation dataset. 
The market historical data set of real estate valuation are collected from Xindian Dist., New Taipei City, Taiwan. 
This dataset was sourced from the UCI machine learning repository. 
The dataset has 7 columns and a total of 414 rows. Below are details regarding the attributes. Out of the 7 columns, Y (house price of area unit) is the target variable
## Objectives:
- To explore the dataset in order to gain insights into the Taiwanese real estate market. 
- Explore the relationship between between variables and their distributions
- Understand what factors into the valuation of housing. Such understanding could potentially lead to selection of a suitable machine learning model to predict other housing price
## Conclusion:
After analysis, I came to know that surprising that the value of houses don't increase as much over the years, it maybe also very dependent on the age and location of the house. 
In addition, based on the data distribution, it might suggest that Xindiang district seems to be in the process of further development.
